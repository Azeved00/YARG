# Yet Another Racing Game (YARG)

Yarg is built in C++ using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com),

it will be a kind of rouge like (or lite, not decided) game

# Issues & Ideas in development:

1. A Point system.
1. Different Roads randomly chosen.
1. Full screen Support.
1. THe player should not be allowed to leave the road.
    1. Maybe add a padding around the road for the player to have a little more space to manuver
1. Time is not being counted correctly.

# Ideas for the future:

1. Better Menus.
1. Add more game modes.
    1. Drag,
    1. Drift,
    1. Time rush,
    1. Dodge.
1. Use textures for the cars insted of squares.
