# Yet Another Racing Game (YARG)

Yarg is built in C++ using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com),

it will be a kind of rouge like (or lite, not decided) game

# Issues & Ideas in development:

1. A Point system.
1. Different Roads randomly chosen.
1. Full screen Support.
1. The player should not be allowed to leave the road.
    1. Maybe add a padding around the road for the player to have a little more space to manuver
1. Time is not being counted correctly.
1. Make car turn with a and d insted of having X speed
1. Add a rectangle as the finishing line somewhere on the track and when player croses that its when you finish
1. Change everythin to whitin namespaces
1. enemy spawn values (width) needs reajustment

# Ideas for the future:

1. Better Menus.
1. Add more game modes.
    1. Drag,
    1. Drift,
    1. Time rush,
    1. Dodge.
1. Use textures for the cars insted of squares.
